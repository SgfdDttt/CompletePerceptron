# Running
You need ocaml to run compile the .ml files.
Run the bash script compile.sh
Run xxx_vs_yyy to run all 3 algorithms on the given set of data. Results will be outputted to the console. To run the algorithms on your own data, have a look at the XxxVsYyy.ml files and change the appropriate parts - you might need to write an interface to read your data.

TO DO
